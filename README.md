<p>Greetings! My name is Danitza Saint-Aubin.  
I have been working in the healthcare for nearly 10 years. I am a patient administration specialist at Mount Sinai Health System based in New York and I am agressively seeking other great opportunities. I am an aspiring health-tech specialist with a stong focus on software engineering. In 2022, I decided to continue my educaiton by earning a masters in health informatics. I am currently working on multiple projects through Zero to Mastery Academy. One of my goals is to collaboratate with different jr. software engineers and more experienced software engineer experts in order for me to gain new insight & experience. The goals I plan to achieve would allow me to face many new challenges and work my way into becoming a successful software engineer.
I look forward to curating various projects that would enhance my overall skills in order to showcase them and discuss possible front-end job opportunities. Please feel free to view my projects below.
