<p>Greetings! My name is Danitza Saint-Aubin.  
I have been working in the healthcare for nearly 10 years. I am a patient administration specialist at Mount Sinai Health System based in New York and I am agressively seeking other great opportunities. I am an aspiring health-tech specialist with a stong focus on data analytics, business analytics, EHR implementaiton speciaist, and system analytics. In 2022, I decided to continue my educaiton by earning a masters in health informatics. I am currently working on earning a Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Google. One of my goals is to collaboratate with different data analyst experts in order for me to gain new insight & experience. The goals I plan to achieve would allow me to face many new challenges and work my way into becoming a successful data analyst.
I look forward to curating various projects that would enhance my overall skills in order to showcase them and discuss possible data analytics job opportunities. Please feel free to view my projects below.
